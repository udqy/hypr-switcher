# hypr-switcher

Switch surfaces (windows) in Hyprland.

Stack breakdown:

Will use C++ since Hyprland is written in the same language.

Not sure about the GUI library but leaning towards Qt since it's already installed in Hyprland. 

Write good code. Should be fast.

Might:

- Make it a Hyprland plugin.
- Create a daemon that listens to Alt+Tab or any specified keypress.
